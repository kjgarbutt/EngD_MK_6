# EngD_MK_6
 * "MK_6" is the sixth iteration of my EngD project model. It is adapted from
 * the MASON demo, "Gridlock", made by Sarah Wise, Mark Coletti, and Andrew Crooks.
 * 
 * The model reads a number of GIS shapefiles and displays a road network, two
 * Environment Agency flood maps and a bespoke Open Source Vulnerability Index (OSVI).
 * The model reads in a .CSV and generates a predetermined number of agents with set
 * characteristics. The agents are placed on the road network and are located at
 * a Red Cross office. The model reads a separate .CSV and assigns goal locations to 
 * each agent at random from a predetermined list. The agents are assigned speeds at
 * random.
 * Once the model is started, the agents move from A to B, then they change direction
 * and head back to their start position. The process repeats until the user quits.
